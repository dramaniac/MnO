00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,510
That's why you wanted me to return home.

349
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:10,250
-Is he that dangerous?
-No, it's not a big deal.

350
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,300
-You are scared.
-Huh?

351
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,270
But Sakagami-san promised to do what he can.

352
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,590
If we leave it to him, it should be alright.

353
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:22,090
-Who is this Sakagami-san?
-He was a fellow student of mine.

354
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,280
Now he's a detective at the Metropolitan Police.

355
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:28,470
Before we got married, we competed for her.

356
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:31,270
-And you won?
-Seems so.

357
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,350
That was once.

358
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,690
But he isn't resentful?

359
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:39,180
He's not that kind of person.
According to him...

360
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,450
...what this guy called Kunieda has committed

361
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:44,800
were lots of threats and interfering with a public official in the line of duty.

362
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,150
Right now Sakagami's detectives
are going to his apartment.

363
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:51,470
That's good for you, onii-chan.

364
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,970
Umm.

365
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:58,280
Oh! Sakagami.

366
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,470
Hello. I'm sorry. How did it go?

367
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:08,690
Eh?! I see. I got it. Thank you.

368
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:12,210
-What's going on?
-He said that Kunieda has disappeared.

369
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,710
Eh?!

370
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,850
He disappeared in anticipation that the police might come after him.

371
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:21,270
Then does it mean he is targeting Matsushima-kun?

372
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:24,440
Well, I don't know about it.

373
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,020
You might need to stay at home to take extra precaution.

374
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,840
No, I can't do that.

375
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,970
But the guy, Kunieda, has some criminal record beside cannabis, right?!

376
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:38,740
I can't stay at home because I will have the residents' meeting tomorrow.

377
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,850
Ah, I was thinking to go to see the actual place today.

378
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,540
It's not really necessary to visit the place.

379
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,710
You just need to bow down at the meeting.

380
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,950
I don't want to be rude to the residents.

381
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,260
Most importantly is your physical safety.

382
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,580
That's right. I'll give you another chance.

383
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,090
Stay at home today.

384
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,090
Because you, Kumazawa and the others...

385
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,090
have worked hard to get me back...

386
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,630
-it's not the time to run and hide.
-You pretend to be tough.

387
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,500
I don't pretend. I just proceed logically.

388
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,170
Which means I'm off.

389
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,770
Hey!
Ah.

390
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,950
Hello.

391
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,580
Oh, Yoshino, what's up?

392
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,960
-I am angry.
-What?

393
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,560
-Why?
-Because...

394
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,590
Sorry that I dragged you to this place.

395
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:40,450
-Hum.
-Cheer up.

396
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,250
Why didn't you tell me that you
are facing such a danger?

397
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,940
Kumazawa-san told me about it.

398
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,540
-You would only be worried.
-Probably.

399
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:57,530
Ah, here it is.

400
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:28,090
-Say.
-Hmm.

401
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,950
You are not Narumi-san's boyfriend,...

402
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,600
...you didn't know her two years ago.

403
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,420
If you tell Kunieda that, won't that help?

404
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,760
But I don't even know where he is.

405
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,930
-Why don't you leave a message on his phone?
-Hmm.

406
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,960
If you don't even do that in this danger, you are like an idiot.

407
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,160
Ah, I dunno.

408
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,460
-Do you want to protect Narumi-san?
-Huh?

409
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,890
Because you want to protect her you
draw the danger to yourself.

410
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:01,380
-Why should I.
-Then why?

411
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,860
If you wanted to do the residents' meeting properly

412
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:08,270
you normally would shake off the sparks which fall on you.

413
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:13,610
Hmm. I don't run away just because it's dangerous...

414
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:16,710
...and I want to do the things I have to do properly.

415
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:19,510
You can call me an idiot for that.

416
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,940
Then...

417
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:31,930
...if something happened to me would you protect me?

418
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,930
Of course I would.

419
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,910
-Shin-chan, it's time for supper.
-Yes.

420
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,890
Bye bye.

421
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:58,020
-Yes.
-Umm...is Matsushima-san there?

422
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,900
-Any help.
-I'm fine.

423
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:26,880
-You know Narumi, right?
-Yes, that's right.

424
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,880
Tell her this:

425
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:35,620
I might go to prison once more.

426
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:40,720
Ah...is your name Kunieda?

427
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,130
Bye.

428
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:57,380
What? He came to you? Why?

429
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,610
He sounded like he is up to something.

430
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:02,350
Once with resolve.

431
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,990
-Is it okay if you stay away.
-Why not?

432
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:08,290
If you say so.

433
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:11,560
Don't say to me later,
"Why didn't you tell me?"

434
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,710
Just in case I called you. See ya.

435
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,550
Good afternoon.
Welcome.

436
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,020
Business development department.

437
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,090
Umm..is Matsushima-san there?

438
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:41,220
Matsushima-san isn't here

439
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,440
-Where is he?
-Ah!

440
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,430
Aren't you the one who visited Matsushima-san recently?

441
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,230
Just tell me where he is.

442
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,180
I cannot do that.

443
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,620
Oh well. He is in a dangerous situation.

444
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,350
If anything happens to him it's your fault.

445
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,020
What?

446
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,840
Ladies and gentleman,
you came here even though...

447
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,340
you were very busy. I deeply appreciate that.
I hereby open...

448
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:22,160
...the residents' meeting of Honmachi garden hills.

449
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,990
There are no legal problems
with the construction plans,

450
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,690
the architectural basis is...

451
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:40,000
What we want to hear is not that
type of speech.

452
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,930
Will these apartments...

453
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:46,390
...have an influence on our life or not.

454
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,760
We want an actual discussion about that.

455
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,640
But this might be a subjective question.

456
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,000
-Are you dodging the problem?
-No, I don't intend to do that.

457
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,280
We are not just following the basic laws...

458
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,890
...we are being attentive not to disturb more of the environment you are living in.

459
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:05,190
We would like to explain it with the best of intentions...

460
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,790
...and we would like you to have a much better understanding.

461
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,790
You think that bowing solves everything?!

462
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:14,900
-You are dodging!
-That's right!

463
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,280
I appreciate it if you understand, please.

464
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,500
-Why don't you say anything?
-Err...yes.

465
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,360
Please answer.

466
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,350
Will there be an influence on our life or not.

467
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:11,790
Will the apartments cause us problems or not?

468
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,390
An influence...

469
00:38:19,496 --> 00:38:21,052
[Manual : how to deal a residents' meeting]

470
00:38:21,052 --> 00:38:23,048
[Do not tell details and just bow down]

471
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:27,020
An influence...

472
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,600
An influence exists.

473
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,920
I think it will cause you problems.

474
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,230
What's he saying?
Is he serious?

475
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:57,750
According to these data...

476
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,170
...the planning commissionary tried extremely hard...

477
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:05,270
but with the building of the apartments,

478
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:10,050
the estates to the north will lose 1.5 hours
of sunshine on average.

479
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,550
But in exchange, if the appartmets are built

480
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:20,690
there will come new families. Total of 43 new families.

481
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:23,290
-What does it matter?
-It matters.

482
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:29,280
Yesterday I walked in this neighborhood.

483
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,150
I felt that this is a really friendly neighborhood.

484
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:36,270
I heard a mother calling her child for supper...

485
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,270
...it's been a long time for me since I saw that.

486
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,200
In this wonderful town...

487
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,700
...you might have 43 new families as neighbors.

488
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,650
Would you please accept them?

489
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,750
More people living might cause...

490
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,620
...chafe, inconvenience or something may happen with the change.

491
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,620
However, does it have to be zero of them?

492
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,500
Having new residents might give...

493
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,120
...some hard time for each other.

494
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,820
But there must be a lot of happiness...

495
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,710
...sharing with new people, I think.

496
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:13,010
Isn't that life?!

497
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:20,650
Getting close to a person you thought that you wouldn't like...

498
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:24,740
...but the person becomes a precious one someday.

499
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,390
I think that it's possible that it might happen.

500
00:40:33,352 --> 00:40:36,072
[Stop being such a stupid wrongdoer.]

501
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:43,140
Just a little...

502
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,330
...would you please have the courage to open your hearts?

503
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:55,440
[I will be waiting for you with mom. You can come back any time. -Your father.]

504
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,060
Was what I said naive?

505
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:43,140
You...are naive.

506
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:52,560
Naive but...

507
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,700
that's not bad.

508
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,300
Huh?

509
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,880
Up to now there was nobody
who didn't run away...

510
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,480
...and explained properly.

511
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,830
What do you think?

512
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:55,120
Thank you very much.

513
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,020
It's okay.

514
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,580
May I offer my help?

515
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,720
Thank you very much.

516
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,040
Good morning.

517
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,290
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

518
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,280
Good morning.

519
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,600
We will have a meeting for a new project.

520
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:29,630
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

521
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,220
-Good morning.
-Oh.

522
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,620
Thank you for waiting.

523
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:46,880
And what did this Kunieda do after that?

524
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,400
He returned directly to his parents' farm.

525
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,480
You always liked...

526
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,590
...growing plants.

527
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,560
Seems so.

528
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,590
He's just the right person for the job.

529
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:16,590
-It's because of Matsushima.
-He is a really weird guy.

530
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:40,520
I need to talk to you.

531
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:45,190
-May I leave my seat?
-It's okay.

532
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:46,790
What is it?

533
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,880
You are pretending to be a nice person, and it feels good to you, right?!

534
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,560
Sometimes, it is nice to be just the two of us.

535
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,230
That girl likes you.

536
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,880
-Do your best!
-I like you...

537
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,550
-Umm...
-He puts up a big front but...

538
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:11,220
...can't see himself.

539
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:14,220
-Promises are for breaking.
-You are done here.

540
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,300
Why didn't you leave me alone.
