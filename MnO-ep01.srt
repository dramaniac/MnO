00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,520
From America, right?

5

Yes.

It is the right address here.

I heard that it'll arrive today and waited here.
I'll take it.

Ah, hello.

00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,570
...so maybe God invited me.

189
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,770
I dropped it.

190
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,610
Are you God?

191
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,620
No!

192
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,330
Anyway, you used someone else's invitation
to eat and drink.

193
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,140
Towards me and towards the host of the party,

194
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,320
it's doubly rude.

195
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,360
I almost ate up. Shall I return it?

196
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,160
It's okay. You don't have to.
That's not the problem.

197
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,230
Then what should I do?

198
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,190
First it would be appropriate to show some regret.

199
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,070
In a spontaneous impulse,
one might do things like that...

200
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,710
Won't you stop eating?

201
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,030
Huh?

202
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,320
What?

203
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,220
Ouch. Ouch. It hurts.

204
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,520
Don't fake an illness.

205
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,850
Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.

206
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,750
Are you serious?

207
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,310
Hold on?

208
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,750
Is this real?

209
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,770
Are you okay?
Hold out a little.

210
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,360
Excuse me. She doesn't feel well.

211
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:55,800
Could you call an ambulance?

212
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,410
Yes.

213
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,620
But Touto hospital is right over there.

214
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,090
You might go there directly.
Yes.

215
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,030
Thank you.

216
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:02,960
Let's go.

217
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,540
Don't use a cell phone in the hospital.

218
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,600
I'm sorry.

219
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,700
Where is he?

220
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,860
How is she?

221
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,800
Where has she been up to now?

222
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,720
In the assembly room of the hotel over there.

223
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,540
She shows an intense digestive reaction.

224
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,200
In other words she simply ate too much.

225
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,160
Huh?

226
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,600
Take care.

227
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,440
That's from eating too much.

228
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,240
Cause for once I sneaked into a party...

229
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,840
...I wanted to eat two meals at once.

230
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,920
Don't you have any money?

231
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,350
Like 300 yen.

232
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,220
Why do you only have 300 yen?

233
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,180
It's complicated why people are poor...

234
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,180
...moreso than why some are rich.

235
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,140
But a single young woman...

236
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,350
...can earn her living somehow.

237
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,800
Dirty.

238
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,130
You mean that I become a prostitute?

239
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,740
Pardon?

240
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,010
I didn't mean that.

241
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:43,060
And you are working in a construction firm?
Are you building houses?

242
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:47,090
To be exact I make the construction plans.

243
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,730
I once built a plastic model from Himeji castle.

244
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,780
The donjon from Himeji castle is
architecturally speaking

245
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,190
a compound donjon, the most intricate structure.

246
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,830
No one wants to hear that.

247
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,340
You started it.

248
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,950
How will I get along tomorrow?

249
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,120
There's also the hospital bill.

250
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,170
Here.

251
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,690
Huh? Is it okay?

252
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,370
Yeah.

253
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,300
I'll give it back. Give me your number.

254
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,720
Don't worry about it.

255
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,610
Ah! Crap!

256
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,060
Bye!

257
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,900
Don't do that ever again.

258
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,190
Good evening.

259
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,240
Welcome.

260
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,000
One beer.

261
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,520
From the tap.

262
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,940
-Sorry. Sorry.
-Finally you came.

263
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,330
O yes. You are late.

264
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,810
These two are already drunk.

265
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,010
And? How did it go?

266
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,370
Not yet. I didn't do anything.

267
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,350
I need your assistance I said.

268
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,140
Let's do it now.

269
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,730
Too late. I'm already drunk.

270
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,960
What are you whispering?

271
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,860
Ah nothing.

272
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,110
Are you having fun?

273
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,680
We talked about Kumi's spouse hunting.

274
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,050
I wanna marry.

275
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,040
One more.

276
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,710
Me too.

277
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,210
Ah, my marriage line disappears.

278
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,190
Do you need a pen?

279
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,410
Thanks.

280
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,910
-Thank you.
-I might marry you.

281
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:27,760
Huh?

282
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,190
My ex-boyfriend...

283
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,350
I should have married him.

284
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,270
Regretting now?

285
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,030
No use crying over spilt milk.

286
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,600
Like this guy.

287
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,900
What about me?

288
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,450
You were already accepted
by Dainihon Construction

289
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,100
You had the chance to enter a top 5 business.

290
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,810
Don't talk about it.

291
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,460
What? I didn't know that.

292
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,650
You heard about the Dainichi cover-up scandal?

293
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,780
I heard about it.

294
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,630
That company forged the contents of a survey.

295
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,690
They developed something that harmed the ecosystem.

296
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,920
He knew that and refused.
What an idiot.

297
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,180
I didn't want to enter a firm that forges data.

298
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,170
But it's your childhood dream...

299
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,850
...to construct big buildings and bridges.

300
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,140
For this type of projects, you need to work for
a large construction firm.

301
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,730
You think you can build big stuff with our firm?

302
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:11,260
I can.

303
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,260
How?

304
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,570
I will make our firm able to do that. Yes.

305
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,590
You are really...

306
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,230
What? Stop it.

307
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,030
Really an idiot.

308
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,570
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

309
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,220
Let's have a toast.

310
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,610
On our future.

311
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,100
Cheers!

312
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:39,410
Let's drink today! One more beer.

[Frontier Constructions - Staff housing]

314
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,090
Ah, I drank too much.

315
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,010
Uh, I drank too much.
(Matsuhima Nami, Kenichiro's younger sister )

316
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,510
While you are a bummer, don't drink that much.

317
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,980
I am not a bummer. I have a part-time job.

318
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,360
Hey, don't fall asleep again.
Sit up straight.

319
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,310
It's okay.
Your sermon will be long.

320
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,590
For what have you been supported through university?

321

00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,660
I can't help it.

323
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,370
The firm went bankrupt.

324
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,260
You shouldn't have entered such a firm.

325
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,490
Anyway, don't make our parents worry.

326
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,100

It's hopeless.

Oops!

329
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,960
But it's surely good that you have at least a part-time job.

330
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:50,400
That's uncommon. You agree with me.

331
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,090
There exist much worse women than you.

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,750

No shadow, no form, like air.
To be frank...

336
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,480
...I want to break up.

337

Not a little, a lot.

Huh? When I am tense I mispronounce.

00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:12,650
But it's central to this project...

371
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:13,480
...to ask him to do middle class apartments.

372
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,150
It's pointless.

373
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,770
Being restrained by a tight budget is below his league.

374
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,600
We don't know if we don't ask.

375
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,940
Completely pointless.

376
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,560
I understand what Matsushima-san says, but...

377
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,240
Shut up!

378
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,910
Sorry.

379
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,120
-Hi.
-Yamaguchi-sensei.

380
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,420
Sorry. Do you mind the budget?

381
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,630
The budget you proposed...
(Yamazaki Yoshiki - Sales manager of the business development department)

382
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,700
...was accepted by Yamaguchi-sensei.

383
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,130
What? Really?

384
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,000
Is it alright?

385
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,290
Isn't it troubling you?

386
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,700
To deliver even under ...

387
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,120
...a limited budget, can't a pro do that?

388
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,530
Matsushima-kun, you said so?

389
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,360
You came to my office everyday
and begged me that eagerly...

390
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,980
...so I can't withdraw from it. Cause I'm a pro.

391
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,330
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

392
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:58,100
I'll introduce Yamaguchi-sensei
to the president.

393
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,140
Yes.

394
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,840
See y'all.

395
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,280
Thank you very much.

396
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,420
He gave in to you.

397
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,280
I knew that he'd understand me.

398
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:13,960
Right!

399
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,830
Since Yamaguchi-sensei will work for this,
the client wants...

400
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,440
...to make this space a bit wider.

401
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,640
Is this feasible?

402
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,580
That's tricky.

403
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,230
I know that it's tricky but...

404
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,630
could you at least try.

405
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,010
Matsushima-san.

406
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,380
A visitor.

407
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,180
Who?

408
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,970
A visit during work from
such a person?
(Kuwata Sachiko - Frontier Constructions)

409
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:36,930
What does that mean?

410
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,480
Such a person?

411
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,170
Why are you here?

412
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,270
Show more reaction.

413
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,940
Why did you come to my company.
And how did you know?

414
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,820
The party invitation was for
Matsushima Kenichiro, Frontier Constructions.

415
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,250
What do you want?

416
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,460
About the money I borrowed.

417
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,840
Ah, you came to return it?
Exceptionally honest.

418
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,100
Huh?

419
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,440
I borrowed 5,000 yen.

420
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:26,530
So what?

421
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,180
Aren't 5,000 yen sort of incomplete?

422
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,270
When you add another 5,000 yen they
perfectly add up to 10,000 yen.

423
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,110
You want me to lend you another 5,000 yen?

424
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,320
You can say so.

425
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:43,590
I refuse.

426
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,120
Stingy.

427
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,570
I'm not stingy.

428
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,760
I hate such piecemeal.

429
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,290
I don't have any duty to lend you more money.

430
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,130
Not a duty but there's kindness.

431
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,570
I don't care! Go home.

432
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,800
The lunch break is soon.

433
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,010
Is this a party?
You will overeat again.

434
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,140
When I can eat as much as I like...

435
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,750
...I'd like to eat for one week in advance.

436
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:24,860
Listen. In life you have to...

437
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,990
There are men who get women around
with this type of sermons.

438
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,820
Don't mix things up.

439
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,480
Was your character always like that?
To say what is rightful.

440
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,550
That's not my intention.

441
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,040
Maybe it's the influence of my passed away dad.

442
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,910
My dad was a straightforward man. Itadakimasu.

443
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,740
But isn't it tiresome to not even be a little crooked?

444
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,180
There's a limit to being crooked.

445
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,180
Am I that crooked?

446
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,020
You are snaky.

447
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,850
That's my individuality.

448
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,980
Try living seriously and honestly.

449
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,180
You'll feel better and your future will be bright.

450
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,960
As a couple we would fail a matching test horribly.

451
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,360
How should I care?

452
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,300
When did your father die?

453
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,260
When I was in fourth grade.

454
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,830
Good people die early.

455
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:29,350
And? You don't have any work?

456
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,220
There is no suitable work.

457
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,880
There are lots of job offers from
supermarkets and restaurants.

458
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,660
I am suited for more creative work.

459
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:42,190
Creative?
Have you done such work?

460
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,930
Hmm. Like cameraman or illustrator.

461
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,570
Ah, Really?

462
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,840
I freelanced a lot.

463
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,310
And also as writer.

464
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,980
Maybe our public relations department has such work.

465
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,200
Something great, glamorous and well paid, please.

466
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,780
Don't be so spoilt. Did I even say...

467
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,580
that I'll help you find work.

468
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,850
If you don't feel like it then don't mention it.

469
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,430
Well, I could ask.

470
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,000
When you say that I cannot refuse.

471
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,190
What am I doing?

472
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,980
What are you doing?

473
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,940
For take home.

474
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,810
Don't do that.

475
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,370
Then what will I eat tonight?

476
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,590
What? You could have given me that earlier.

477
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,390
You don't need to give it back.

478
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,220
I'll give it back.

479
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,560
You don't need to.

480
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,370
I'll do.

481
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,540
Don't come and give it back.

482
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,770
I will come.

483
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,840
I just came by your store.

484
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:02,480
And thought: why not have lunch together?

485
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,260
Last night while being drunk, I didn't say anything weird?

486
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,280
It's okay.

487
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,620
But the two of you are good friends, huh?

488
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,260
Me and?

489
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,300
Ken-chan and you.

490
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,450
Ah.

491
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,540
We entered the firm at the same time.
During a training course we had a huge argument.

492
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,350
A huge argument? Why?

493
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:26,470
When I disagreed openly with the instructor...

494
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,620
...he said that this is rude.

495
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,120
But after that we strangely fit together.

496
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,110
Umm.

497
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:36,010
While we are at it how did you meet him?

498
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,710
He hasn't told you?

499
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:38,170
No.

500
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,490
By chance one can say...

501
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,840
((It's been a one-way street here for a long time.))

502
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,940
((I'm telling you that I didn't see the one-way sign.))

503
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,290
((Ah, you were careless.))

504
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,060
((Show me your driver's license.))

505
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,600
((Please...))

506
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,050
((Excuse me, but...

507
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,010
... the sign is really hard to see.))

508
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,270
((I beg your pardon?))

509
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,810
((I have been thinking...

510
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,040
... you should not be policing here.))

511
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,660
((Why don't you stay over there and warn people at the entrance?))

512
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,200
((What are you telling me?))

513
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,760
((That is really for the citizens.))

514
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,950
((It's okay.))

515
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:16,720
((It's not okay.))

516
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,420
((I'm sorry.))

517
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,240
((You wanted to protect the citizens,...

518
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,380
... that's why you became a policeman, right?))

519
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:24,740
((Well....))

520
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,750
((Isn't it true?))

521
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,740
((Excuse us.))

522
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,400
((Here, please.))

523
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,200
((It's still hard to see.))

524
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,720
((A little more please.))

525
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,450
((Ah, that's it, over there.))

526
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,770
That's what happened.

527
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,850
Why hasn't he told you?

528
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,120
It's not an unusual thing to him.

529
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,420
But it had an impact on me.

530
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,110
He is silly, isn't he?!

531
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,600
He is silly.

532
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,100
However, it would be boring without someone like him.

533
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:24,760
That's why...

534
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,620
((Now we can see it well. Yes, it's perfect.))

535
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,900
((Thank you very much.))

536
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,450
((Thank you very much. Excuse me.))

537
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,890
((Excuse me.))

538
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,480
You spoke to him first.

539
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,300
I felt that I would never meet someone like him again.

540
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,420
I'm glad that I spoke to him.

541
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:20,280
Ah... I just remember that I have something to do.

542
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,890
I'm sorry. Would you eat lunch by yourself?

543
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:24,850
Sure.

544
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,010
Then, see you.

545
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,000
See you.

546
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:54,580
Good work.

547
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,210
Who might it be?

548
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,770
Ah, good work today.

549
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,240
Ah, good work.

550
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,320
Listen to this.

551
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,170
A girl came.

552
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:06,760
Um?

553
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,670
A girl came.

554
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:09,350
Eh?!

555
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,190
Really?

556
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:10,710
Really.

557
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,130
Hey.

558
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,230
Hey.

559
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:14,810
Um?

560
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:15,660
Who was the girl?

561
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:16,560
Eh?!

562
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,880
She was a quite cute girl.

563
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,370
Hey!

564
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,820
Come on, who was it?

565
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,130
The girl from the party last night.

566
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,440
You...
What....

567
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,020
Are you involved with such a girl?!

568
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,010
It wasn't my intention.

569
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:31,770
She came here.

570
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:32,570
For what?

571
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,480
I thought that she would give me my money back....

572
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,310
You lent her money?!

573
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,250
You got your money back?

574
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,990
She took more.

575
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:44,650
What are you doing.
Anyway, don't see her again.

576
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,460
Uh...I guess.

577
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,600
What is this inarticulate answer?!

578
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,360
I told her that I help her find a job.

579
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:54,630
When I leave her alone, she's probably in a terrible situation.

580
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,720
Even so, why you...

581
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,770
I got involved in her life by fate...

582
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,460
...I think that I have an obligation to help her.

583
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,440
No, you don't. How can you give attention to another girl?

584
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,850
Um? Who is the other girl?

585
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:07,900
Well...

586
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,250
That's enough!

587
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,800
How was the audition?

588
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,580
Would I look like this if they had chosen me?

589
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,440
Then, I'll treat you to something.

590
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,640
I got 5,000 yen, let's have fun!

591
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:36,550
How did you get 5,000 yen? You have a boyfriend now?

592
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:41,740
It's from a man, but....

593
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,420
(Yabe Norio, owner of the Bar Rybeus)

594
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:46,850
(Yabe Norio, owner of Bar Rybeus)

595
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,150
Ah!

596
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,580
Long time no see.

597
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,260
You're still alive.

598
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,800
Same to you.

599
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,690
Who is this?

600
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,210
Ah, we had a little...before, right?

601
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,180
This and that.

602
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,610
You mean your ex-girlfriend?

603
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,100
I guess so.

604
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,870
I had no idea I was your girlfriend.

605
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,600
I guess not.

606
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,960
You don't have any relationship with her now, right?

607
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,480
Nope. Good bye.

608
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,250
Since we met again, let's go eat.

609
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,920
You just ate, didn't you?

610
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,040
Ah, right.

611
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:22,440
Come on.

612
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,640
I recently opened a bar nearby...

613
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,990
...it's called "Rybeus". You should come sometime, okay?

614
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,710
He's still an irresponsible man.

615
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,120
If even you call him "irresponsible", he really must be.

616
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,550
Wait, how about eating?

617
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,320
Good. I guess this is it for today.

618
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,760
The client requested it, but he didn't expect...

619
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:05,360
...you would do it. He was really happy.

620
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,870
I will do my best to live up to your enthusiasm.

621
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,720
It's a plesure to work with you.

622
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,250
Same to you.

623
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,590
Excuse me.

624
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:15,760
Ah, she is here.

625
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,350
This is the person I was talking about on the phone.

626
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,380
Ah, yes, yes.

627
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,140
This is the interior designer Yamaguchi-san who helps us a lot.

628
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:31,530
Greeting.

629
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:32,960
Ah, hi.

630
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,730
Don't you have a better greeting?

631
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,050
I'm sorry.

632
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,500
Are you really sure? I don't know...

633
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,580
...if she will be useful or not.

634
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,500
Ah, it's okay.

635
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,050
An assistant designer suddenly quit...

636
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,770
...I appreciate that you quickly found someone new.

637
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,740
I'm here, you will be fine.

638
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,050
Good!

639
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,450
Excuse us.

640
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:56,210
Listen, from now on, he will be helping us at work...

641
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,690
...so make sure that you won't be rude to him.

642
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,090
I get it.

643
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,580
Do you really?

644
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:04,300
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but would you start helping me?

645
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,110
Sure.

646
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:09,780
Then come here. Well...

647
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,970
...this is what I'm working on right now...

648
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,970
...there is a table and chairs, right?

649
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,990
Excuse me. I'm leaving now.

650
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:19,690
Okay.

651
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,820
Thanks! See you.

652
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:27,050
-So casual.
-The fabric that sofa set needs...

653
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,590
Oh, Matsushima-kun.

654
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,120
What is it?

655
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,600
You should know?

656
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,490
Will you come in?

657
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:12,310
I was just passing by.

658
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,810
I didn't want to bother you at work.

659
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,760
That's fine. Keep going.

660
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,100
What was that?

661
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:30,020
It's Matsushima.

662
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,130
Were you the one who introduced...

663
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,280
...Kurita Narumi to Yamaguchi-sensei?

664
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,460
Huh? Did she bungle something?

665
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,060
If it were just that!

666
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:39,670
What?!

667
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,330
She tried to steal money from Yamaguchi-sensei's office...

668
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,830
...and was arrested.

669
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,400
Here you go.

670
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,560
Thank you.

671
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,850
[Yamazaki]

672
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,260
Here they are.

673
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,670
Wow! They look nice.

674
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,400
Are you sure that we can have them?
(Yamazaki Tamami, wife of sales manager Yamazaki)

675
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,590
Oh, please.
(Yamazaki Tamami, wife of sales manager Yamazaki)

676
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,910
I told our mother that we have no need, but she keeps sending them.

677
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,220
Then I will have them. Thank you.

678
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,540
Yamaguchi-sensei...

679
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,300
...dropped the lawsuit against her.

680
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,230
For future businesses...

681
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,620
...he doesn't intend to ask you to be responsible either.

682
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:52,200
Yes.

683
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,300
Master...
(Yamazaki Ryosuke, son of sales manager Yamazaki)

684
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,170
(Yamazaki Ryosuke, son of sales manager Yamazaki)

685
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,160
...teach me Judo.

686
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,740
I'm sorry, maybe next time.

687
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,240
Why don't you help mom.

688
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,380
Yeees.

689
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:07,970
Ah, Ryo-kun.

690
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:08,830
I will help you.

691
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:09,740
Okay, then...

692
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,050
...take these chopsticks.

693
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,820
She keeps silence at the police station.

694
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:16,170
Looks like she accepts her guilt.

695
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,440
I'm really sorry.

696
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:24,120
You didn't have a close relationship with her?

697
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:27,460
Of course not. I had only a litte bit to do with her.

698
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,460
Then forget about her.

699
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:29,640
Yes.

700
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:32,630
Ah, that's the awful woman you talked about the other day.

701
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,450
Don't listen to someone else's conversation.

702
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:35,460
You should not see her again.

703
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,870
You are naive, so you are easily deceived.

704
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,480
I don't want you to tell me that.

705
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,240
She is worried about you, right?

706
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,850
Anyway, like your sister said, don't get close to her.

707
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,340
That's what I intend to do.

708
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,070
We are worried too.

709
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,280
Because we are like parents to you.

710
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,050
Well, dinner is ready.
Okay.

711
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:58,190
Thank you.

712
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,810
It's such an honor...

713
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,990
...to be assigned as a custodian.

714
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,330
There is nobody else.

715
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,440
How about the friend that you live with?

716
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,780
I can't cause her trouble any more.

717
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,630
You can even be considerate sometimes.

718
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,330
Welcome. Welcome. Please enjoy your stay.

719
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:27,060
So, how long are you staying at your friend's place?

720
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,840
She told me to leave.

721
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,380
Then you can come to my place anytime.

722
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:35,670
Huh? How about the woman from the other day?

723
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:40,600
Ah, her. That's over. I got dumped.

724
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,770
After all, I think that you are the best.

725
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,630
I will pass that on. But I appreciate it for today.

726
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,720
You aren't satisfied with normal men, right?

727
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,210
In the end, man and woman are...

728
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,750
In the end what?

729
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:06,040
I don't know.

730
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:09,070
I would figure it out if we go out again.

731
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,430
Good bye.

732
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,020
Aren't you pinched for money?

733
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,810
I borrowed money from someone. I will bring it back.

734
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:48,590
Well, let's get going.

735
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,850
You don't need to come.

736
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,970
The sales manager asked me to.

737
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:53,290
Hide, we will go apologize to Yamaguchi-sensei.

738
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:53,760
Yes.

739
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,250
Matsushima-san.

740
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,100
The girl came here again.

741
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,850
How she can come here.

742
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:00,400
Where?

743
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,590
She already left.

744
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,150
She wanted to pass this on to you.

745
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:09,320
Where did she go?

746
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,860
How should I know?!

747
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,360
Damn it.

748
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,380
Thanks for waiting.

749
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,180
What time is your audition?

750
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:32,040
11 o'clock.

751
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,280
I will be waiting outside, so you don't get nervous.

752
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,100
Hold on!

753
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:58,540
What is this?

754
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,570
The money I borrowed.

755
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:01,970
How did you get this money?

756
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:04,570
I didn't steal it.

757
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,520
I don't need my money back, and I don't want you to come anymore.

758
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:14,880
What do you mean?

759
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,020
I was wrong about you.

760
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:19,490
I thought that you were a better person.

761
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,000
We promised that since he will be helping us...

762
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,190
...make sure to not be rude to him.

763
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,410
Is there something more rude than stealing his money?

764
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,770
Say something!

765
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,970
Do you think that you are always right?

766
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:41,800
Huh?

767
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,040
Hey!

768
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:14,540
She is an irresponsible person, but she would not steal money.

769
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:19,690
She was attacked by this Yamaguchi.

770
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:20,850
What?

771
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,860
Narumi pushed him away.

772
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:26,130
Then he claimed that Narumi stole his money...

773
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,760
...and called the police.

774
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:29,890
Is that true?

775
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:53,340
Then just tell me.

776
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:03,880
Look!

777
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,780
Did you tell him something unnecessary?

778
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,610
Kinda.

779
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,020
Ah, thanks for waiting.

780
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,860
We are terribly sorry about this.

781
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:40,270
Well, I do business with your company...

782
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,630
...so I thought that I should settle it peacefully this time.

783
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,660
Ah, have a seat.

784
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,220
Thank you, sir.

785
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,530
We really appreciate that...

786
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:54,560
...you settled it peacefully.

787
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:01,180
Well, in the end, my money was not stolen anyway...

788
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:04,650
...and nobody will benefit from the trouble.

789
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:05,610
Thank you very much.

790
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:07,430
Even today, you didn't need to...

791
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:08,450
...come all the way here for that.

792
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:09,900
No, we can't be like that.

793
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:15,170
Anyway, you two should also be prudent...

794
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:16,430
...about a woman like her.

795
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,670
She has a cute face, but she's a slut.

796
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:28,420
I don't know what young people are up to nowadays.

797
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:33,300
Well, I have work to do, so excuse me?

798
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:35,610
Yes.

799
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:40,610
Excuse me...

800
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:53,470
I would like to ask you one thing.

801
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:57,200
What is it?

802
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,150
Is it true that you tried to push her down?

803
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:01,940
Hey!

804
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,050
What are you saying?

805
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:05,020
Is it true?

806
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,050
What do you mean...

807
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,900
What are you talking about?

808
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:13,300
As a joke this is too much.

809
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,360
Please answer me.

810
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:19,890
For me this project is important!

811
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:21,570
Stop it.

812
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:22,580
Is it true?

813
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,230
Please tell me the truth.

814
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,150
Let's leave it as it is for both of us.

815
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:49,320
Then you did it!

816
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,220
If so, then what?

817
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,610
You are going to screw up your work for that woman?

818
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:58,940
If I step down from this project, it won't work out.

819
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,760
You know that, right?

820
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:03,330
That's right. You stop it now.

821
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:05,180
The project's success is more important for the company.

822
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:08,980
You want this project to succeed and advance your career, right?!

823
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:12,530
Do you want to ruin your career for such a woman?

824
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,160
Don't make me more angry.

825
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:21,250
If you do that, I won't keep my mouth shut.

826
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,740
You don't care about your position at the company, huh?

827
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,220
You are....

828
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:34,890
Maybe, she knew what to expect by working here.

829
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:36,770
That's why she didn't say anything to the police.

830
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:37,940
You are wrong!

831
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:42,820
Don't you know how the woman you tried to attack...

832
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:45,700
...felt and why she kept silent at the police station?

833
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,550
Why do you think she could not say anything?

834
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:53,740
It's true that you are an excellent designer.

835
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,420
But you are wrong.

836
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:58,550
Hey, Matsushima.

837
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,710
I don't care if the company does business with you.

838
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:08,070
But I can't work with you.

839
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:16,680
Excuse me.

840
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:25,780
I'm sorry about that. I will talk to the company.

841
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:26,690
Excuse me.

842
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,770
Kenichiro!

843
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,580
I see. So where did Matsushima go?

844
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,670
Anyway, you should come back here.

845
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,210
What?

846
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:37,530
Sorry.

847
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,320
Because I introduced him to you...

848
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,060
...I have hurt you.

849
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,010
It's all right.

850
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:49,740
No, it's not.

851
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,200
You could not say anything even to the police, right?

852
00:52:57,410 --> 00:52:57,830
Yeah.

853
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:04,490
You must have suffered. I am sorry.

854
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,320
A woman cannot talk about such a thing.

855
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,140
Yeah, I cannot.

856
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:24,640
If I confessed, I'ld go to jail.

857
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:28,320
Huh?

858
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,740
I was so nervous that they would find out.

859
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,220
Did you... take the money?

860
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,170
I would never take the money!

861
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:46,990
I took this.

862
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:48,760
Huh? From Yamaguchi-san's office?

863
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,590
The old man tried to push me down...

864
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:52,430
...so I kicked him back.

865
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,580
In this moment, an employee came back to the office, so...

866
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:58,700
...he started to make a fuss that I tried to steal his money...

867
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:59,890
...and he even called the police.

868
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:01,900
((She tried to take money from my desk.))

869
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,540
I got pissed, so I took this in the commotion.

870
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:06,990
((Tell them that she conducted violence.))

871
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,450
((Yes, I got it.))

872
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:13,030
That's from 1980. It must be tens of thousands of yen?!

873
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,560
That much? Lucky!

874
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,790
I know a bar owner, I can sell it to him.

875
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:20,920
You... give it back.

876
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,510
It's fine and too late anyways.

877
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:24,010
It's not fine!

878
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:24,760
Fine!

879
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,470
Let go.

880
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:26,690
You let go!

881
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:27,660
Let go!

882
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:29,780
Return it!

883
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,990
What a waste!

884
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:43,930
I guess we have to compensate him.

885
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:46,680
If you keep quiet he won't know.

886
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,020
I don't like it that way.

887
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:49,870
Are you stupid?

888
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:52,550
I'm fine being stupid!

889
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:18,730
If this one's also expensive?

890
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:41,720
For that reason, Matsushima has been dropped from this project...

891
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:44,500
...and would do field work for a while.

892
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:58,470
So, you have been transferred from the main office?!

893
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,840
If you did something bad, do it better next time.

894
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,640
I am...

895
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:08,400
Damn it!

896
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:16,180
I will live a straightforward life.

897
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:18,810
I will!

898
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:23,860
Lucky!

899
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,320
Yummy.

900
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:50,990
Hey!

901
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:55,900
Don't dig straight!

902
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,130
Bend here.

903
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:02,880
I'm sorry.

904
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:10,280
I'll put it back.

905
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:18,370
Help me please.Come quickly.

906
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:19,980
Do you have an obligation to help her?

907
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:21,900
I can't neglect someone who needs help.

908
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,570
Because you want to protect Narumi-san?

909
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,350
He is up to something.

910
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:27,640
Just get Matsushima here!

911
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,880
Please become a Buddha.

912
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,910
Wouldn't you mind...

913
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:32,010
...opening your hearts a little bit?

914
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:33,780
I need to talk to you.
